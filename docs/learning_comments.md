# Sprint 1

Get together earlier to share problems and more complex aspects of the application, so we can mob to unblock

Progressed some complex aspects really well (e.g. testing devise user setup)

Mob earlier if possible (although our 4pm mob was successful)

Spend time-boxed time learning specific concepts as a pair/team during each sprint

# Sprint 3

We didn't document anything :(

# Sprint 4

- **Learning**: having a retro at the end of each day enabled a really honest check-in on how each of us were feeling -> those who had had a frustrating day could get it out and others talked though the positives that person had given during the day. We were all able to give and receive ideas for helping any negative feelings that have really helped... take more breaks, don’t open your laptop that night, spend time with a coach. Felt like we really owned what we were doing and each others’ wellbeing

- **Learning**: DO MORE - demo to our PO/coach. We got regular opinions and decisions but could do more active demoing for faster feedback

- **Learning**: Go straight to the root of a code smell (something you know doesn't feel right), don’t keep adding to it or ignoring it hoping it will get better! Examples: a non-foreign keyed reference column in a db table, some devise library redirect code
